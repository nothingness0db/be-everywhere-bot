# be-everywhere-bot

**This checkout defaults to opt-in Telegram routing.** Messages without a `#b` marker stay in Telegram;
a message that contains ` #b` anywhere in its text (a space, then `#b`) publishes to Bilibili.
X is disabled in the default routing configuration.
Outbound copies have the marker removed. Configure the rules in [`routing.toml`](routing.toml).
See the [Chinese setup guide / 中文配置说明](README.zh-CN.md) for setup and examples.

A small authenticated dashboard is available with `--dashboard`: account health checks,
publish status and errors, search/filtering, and queued manual retries. Set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`
(12+ characters) first. For Docker, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, choose a password, then run
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dashboard.yml up -d --build`.
It binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default and runs in the same container as the bot.
Open **Accounts & Settings / 账号与配置** to sign in to Bilibili with a QR code or cookies,
connect the Telegram bot/channel, and edit routing intervals and the opt-in marker.
Settings take effect immediately and persist in SQLite. Stored credentials are never echoed
back to the browser. The QR flow is adapted from bili-sync (see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`).

The original multi-network mesh sync is available by explicitly setting `mode = "mesh"` in
`routing.toml`. It supports X (Twitter), Threads, Bluesky, Telegram, Mastodon, Instagram,
LinkedIn, and RSS feeds. Bilibili supports text/image dynamics as a destination only.

## Features

- Telegram #-marker routing by default — configurable marker words and account labels
- Bilibili text/image dynamics via web-session cookies (`--auth=bilibili`)
- Durable Telegram inbox and per-part publishing checkpoints for retries across restarts
- X OAuth 2.0 PKCE authorization, automatic refresh, and v2 media uploads
- **Mesh sync** — every configured account syncs to every other
- **Multiple accounts per network** — connect several Twitter/Telegram/Mastodon accounts with `--label`
- **Thread support** — consecutive posts in the same conversation are merged when the destination allows
- **Duplicate protection** — `sync_mappings` + `mirrored_posts` prevent re-syncing and circular reposts
- **Smart filtering** (X) — skips retweets, quote tweets, `@`-replies, and replies to other people
- **Source-only marker** — append `/x` to a post to keep it on that network only (not mesh-synced)
- **Cross-post attribution** — a mirrored post opens with a `转自我的tg频道` line marking where it came from ([configurable](#configuration))
- **Link unwrapping** — `t.co` and other shorteners are resolved before posting
- **Token renewal** — Meta (Threads, Instagram) 60-day tokens are refreshed automatically before they expire

## Requirements

- **Python 3.13+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** (recommended)
- API credentials for each network you want to connect

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nothingness0db/be-everywhere-bot.git
cd be-everywhere-bot
uv sync

# Connect Bilibili and the Telegram source channel
uv run python main.py --auth=bilibili --label=main
uv run python main.py --auth=telegram --label=main

# Run Telegram prefix routing (or mesh when explicitly enabled in routing.toml)
uv run python main.py
```

## Setup

### Connect accounts

```bash
uv run python main.py --auth=twitter --label=personal
uv run python main.py --auth=twitter --label=work
uv run python main.py --auth=telegram --label=main
uv run python main.py --auth=bilibili --label=main
uv run python main.py --auth=mastodon --label=fedi
uv run python main.py --auth=threads --label=main
uv run python main.py --auth=bluesky --label=main
uv run python main.py --auth=rss --label=blog
uv run python main.py --auth=instagram --label=main
uv run python main.py --auth=linkedin --label=main
```

Re-running `--auth` with the same network + label updates credentials.

Re-running `--auth` with the same network + label updates credentials.

Use `--label` to connect multiple accounts on the same network (e.g. personal and work Twitter).

---

### X (Twitter)

**Portal:** [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard)

**What you need:** OAuth 2.0 Client ID, and a Client Secret for confidential apps.

**Steps:**

1. Sign in at the [X Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard).
2. Create a **Project** and an **App** (or open an existing app).
3. Enable OAuth 2.0 user authentication with Read and Write permissions.
4. Register a callback URL, for example `http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback`.
5. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=twitter --label=main` and provide the OAuth Client ID, optional secret, and registered callback URL.
6. Open the printed authorization link, authorize your account, and promptly paste the full callback URL back into the terminal. No local callback server is started; a connection-error page at localhost is expected.

**Notes:** User tokens are refreshed automatically using `offline.access`. App-only Bearer Tokens cannot publish posts. API permissions and billing must be enabled in the developer portal. Marker mode does not poll X timelines.

---

### Telegram

**Portals:** [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) · [Telegram Bot API docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

**What you need:** Bot token + channel ID

**Steps:**

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram and send `/newbot`.
2. Follow the prompts to name your bot and copy the **bot token** (looks like `123456:ABC-DEF…`).
3. Create a **channel** (or use an existing one) where posts should be synced.
4. Add your bot to the channel as an **administrator** (needs permission to post).
5. Find the channel ID:
   - Public channel: `@yourchannel`
   - Private channel: forward a message to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or use the `-100…` numeric ID from your client
6. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=telegram --label=main` and paste the bot token and channel ID.

**Notes:** The Bot API cannot backfill full channel history — only posts received via `getUpdates` after the bot is set up are synced. For older content, backfill from X or Mastodon instead.

---

### Bilibili (destination only)

Run `uv run python main.py --auth=bilibili --label=main` and enter your own logged-in browser's
`SESSDATA`, `bili_jct`, and optional `buvid3` cookie values. Supports text and image dynamics;
video/GIF posting is not supported. These are web-session endpoints; re-authenticate when the
session expires or Bilibili requires verification. See [the setup guide](README.zh-CN.md).

---

### Mastodon

**Portal:** your instance (e.g. [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social))

**What you need:** Instance URL + access token with `read` and `write` scopes

**Steps:**

1. Log in to your Mastodon instance.
2. Go to **Preferences** → **Development** → **New application** (or open an existing app).
3. Enable scopes **read** and **write**, then create the application.
4. Copy the **Access token** shown for your account.
5. Note your instance base URL (e.g. `https://mastodon.social` — no trailing slash).
6. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=mastodon --label=main` and paste the URL and token.

---

### Threads

**Portal:** [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)

**What you need:** User access token with Threads scopes (optionally the Threads App Secret)

**Steps:**

1. Create or open an app at [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).
2. Add the **Threads API** product to your app.
3. Under **Threads API** → tools / token generator, create a **User access token**.
4. Grant scopes **`threads_basic`** and **`threads_content_publish`**.
5. Copy the access token. Optionally copy the **Threads App secret** from **App settings** → **Basic**.
6. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=threads --label=main` and paste the token (App Secret and username are optional).

**Notes:** Publishing is limited to **250 posts per 24 hours** per profile. Media must be on a **public HTTPS URL** — posts from X/Mastodon usually work; Telegram-sourced media may publish as text-only. See [Meta access tokens](#meta-access-tokens) for how expiry is handled.

---

### Bluesky

**Portal:** Bluesky app → **Settings** → **Privacy and security** → **App passwords**

**What you need:** Handle + app password (not your login password)

**Steps:**

1. Log in to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) (web or app).
2. Open **Settings** → **Privacy and security** → **App passwords**.
3. Create a new app password and copy it (shown once).
4. Note your full handle (e.g. `you.bsky.social`).
5. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=bluesky --label=main` and enter handle and app password.
6. Press Enter for the default PDS (`https://bsky.social`) unless you use a custom server.

---

### RSS (source only)

**What you need:** Feed URL (RSS 2.0 or Atom)

**Steps:**

1. Find the feed URL for your blog or site (often `/feed`, `/feed.xml`, or `/atom.xml`).
2. Verify it loads in a browser or feed reader.
3. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=rss --label=blog` and paste the URL (e.g. `https://example.com/feed.xml`).

**Notes:** RSS is **read-only** — items sync out to your social accounts but nothing is posted back. Each item is published as **title**, **description/summary**, and a **link**. Use `--since=YYYY-MM-DD` on first run to import older items.

---

### Instagram (source only)

**Portal:** [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)

**What you need:** Instagram Business or Creator account + user access token

**Steps:**

1. Convert your Instagram account to **Business** or **Creator** (Instagram app → Account type).
2. Create or open an app at [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).
3. Add the **Instagram** product → **API setup with Instagram login**.
4. Connect your Instagram account and generate a **User access token** with scope **`instagram_business_basic`**.
5. Copy the access token. Optionally copy the **App secret** from **App settings** → **Basic**.
6. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=instagram --label=main` and paste the token (App Secret and username are optional).

**Notes:** Instagram is **read-only** in mesh sync — feed posts and active **stories** (24 h window) flow out to other networks, never in. Media URLs expire; the bot downloads media at publish time. Accounts connected through **Facebook login** are also asked for the **Facebook App ID**, which Meta requires to renew that flavour of token. See [Meta access tokens](#meta-access-tokens).

---

### Meta access tokens

Threads and Instagram user tokens are valid for **60 days** and can be renewed for another 60 — but only while they are still valid. A token that lapses cannot be recovered and the account has to be connected again.

The bot handles this on its own:

- At `--auth` time a short-lived (1 hour) token is exchanged for a 60-day one when you supply the App Secret. Without the secret, an already-long-lived token is accepted as-is.
- Before every fetch or publish, the stored token is renewed if it has less than `META_TOKEN_MIN_REMAINING_DAYS` (14) left. The new token and its expiry are written back to `account_credentials`.
- Failed renewals are retried every `META_TOKEN_RETRY_HOURS` (6) rather than on every sync cycle — Meta rejects tokens younger than 24 hours, so a freshly connected account settles within a day.
- Accounts connected before this feature existed have no recorded expiry; the bot probes them until Meta reports one.

If the bot is stopped for more than 60 days the token expires anyway. You will see `Threads access token expired on … Re-authenticate: …` in the logs — re-run `--auth` for that network.

---

### LinkedIn

**Portal:** [linkedin.com/developers](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps)

**What you need:** Member access token with posting (and ideally reading) scopes

**Steps:**

1. Create an app at [LinkedIn Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) (linked to a Company Page).
2. Under **Products**, request **Share on LinkedIn** and **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**.
3. Open the **Auth** tab and note your OAuth settings (redirect URL if you use the OAuth flow).
4. Generate a **member access token** with scopes:
   - `openid`, `profile`, `email` — identity
   - `w_member_social` — publish posts
   - `r_member_social` — read your posts (may require [LinkedIn approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/lms-faq); without it the account can publish but not act as a source)
5. Run `uv run python main.py --auth=linkedin --label=main` and paste the token.

**Notes:** Long posts are split at 3,000 characters. Thread continuations are posted as comments. Images upload via the LinkedIn Images API (up to 20 per post). Video is not supported yet.

## Running

```bash
uv run python main.py                      # watch mode (default)
uv run python main.py --since=2026-01-01   # backfill from date
uv run python main.py --list-accounts      # show configured accounts
uv run python main.py -v                   # debug logging
```

## Testing

Tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). Install dev dependencies and run the suite:

```bash
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest
```

Verbose output:

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

Coverage includes every network module (`apis/twitter`, `telegram`, `mastodon`, `threads`, `bluesky`, `instagram`, `linkedin`, `rss`), shared helpers (`utils/`), sync engine, and database sync state.

CI runs the same suite on every push and pull request via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).

### Watch mode

Default marker mode polls Telegram every 5 seconds, sends only explicitly selected destinations,
and retries from the local inbox. Albums wait for a 2-second quiet period. Edit `routing.toml`
to change the interval or markers. Changes require a restart.

In optional mesh mode, polls on a **cron schedule** (see `WATCH_CRON` in `config.py`). For each account:

1. Fetches recent posts (skipping mirrored/sync-created posts)
2. Skips posts younger than **20 minutes** (editable window on source networks). Ignored on the first cycle after start/restart (`docker compose up`)
3. Publishes unsynced content to every other account
4. Records mappings so the same content is never reposted again

### Backfill (`--since`)

One-shot sync since the given date. Skips min-age filter, adds a **3 second delay** between publishes. Works for X and Mastodon history; Telegram only picks up posts received via `getUpdates` since the bot was configured.

### Docker

```bash
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=twitter
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=telegram
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=mastodon
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=threads
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=bluesky
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=rss
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=instagram
docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --auth=linkedin
docker compose up -d
```

```

## Configuration

Routing settings are in [`routing.toml`](routing.toml) (or `--config PATH`).
Use `mode = "telegram_prefix"` for opt-in TG publishing or `mode = "mesh"` to restore mesh sync.
A marker is `#` + the configured word (`#b`), placed anywhere in the text after a space.
Marker words can name a network (`"twitter"`) or one account (`"twitter/main"`).
Routing saved from the dashboard takes effect immediately and is stored in SQLite;
it takes precedence over the file configuration after restarts as well.

| Constant | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `POST_MIN_AGE_MINUTES` | `30` | Min age for main posts before publishing; skipped on first watch cycle after start/restart and on `--since` |
| `WATCH_CRON` | `0,30 7-22 * * *` | Watch-mode cron schedule (UTC) |
| `BACKFILL_POST_DELAY_SECONDS` | `3` | Delay between posts in `--since` mode |
| `TWITTER_FETCH_MAX_PAGES` | `10` | Max X API pages per poll (safety cap) |
| `TWITTER_FETCH_PAGE_SIZE` | `10` | X tweets per page; next page only if all are new |
| `WATCH_OVERLAP_HOURS` | `6` | Re-fetch overlap for threads / retries |
| `META_TOKEN_MIN_REMAINING_DAYS` | `14` | Renew Meta tokens once this little of the 60 days is left |
| `META_TOKEN_RETRY_HOURS` | `6` | Backoff between failed Meta token renewals |
| `META_TOKEN_UNKNOWN_EXPIRY_DAYS` | `30` | Renewal cadence when Meta reports no expiry |
| `ATTRIBUTION_TEMPLATES` | `{"bilibili": "转自我的{network}"}` | First line added to mirrored posts; `{network}` = source network, `{source}` = source account; `""` disables it |

### Upgrading an existing install

Pull the new code, rebuild Docker if you use it, then start as usual:

```bash
# Local
uv sync
uv run python main.py          # migrates, then watch mode

# Docker
docker compose build
docker compose up -d           # migrates on container start
```


### Migrate only (no sync)

```bash
uv run python main.py --migrate

docker compose run --rm bot uv run python main.py --migrate
```

Use `-v` to see `Applying migration …` log lines.

## Database

SQLite at `data/be_everywhere.db` (auto-created, migrated on startup):

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `accounts` | Connected accounts (`network` + `label`) |
| `account_credentials` | Tokens and settings per account |
| `sync_mappings` | Propagation tracking (prevents re-sync) |
| `mirrored_posts` | Sync-created posts (prevents circular repost) |
| `account_sync_state` | Last fetch watermark per account |
| `telegram_inbox` | Durable channel messages, saved before confirming updates |
| `outbound_deliveries` | Successfully published parts, allowing retries to resume |
| `sync_jobs` | Publish attempts, errors, status, and manual retries |
| `account_health` | Most recent account login checks |
| `runtime_settings` | Routing settings saved from the dashboard |
| `schema_migrations` | Applied migration versions |

Legacy single-account schema is migrated automatically by `001_mesh_accounts`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No accounts configured | Run `--auth=…` for each network |
| Post not synced yet | Marker mode: check the marker and destination credentials. Mesh mode: check the min-age setting |
| Telegram history missing | Bot API can't backfill channels; use `--since` on X/Mastodon |
| Instagram stories missing | Stories expire after 24 h; run watch mode regularly |
| Circular repost | Should not happen — check `mirrored_posts` is populated |
| HTTP 402 on X | Top up API credits at developer.x.com |
| `Session has expired` on Threads/Instagram | Token lapsed past its 60-day window; re-run `--auth` for that network |

```bash
uv run python main.py -v   # debug logging
```
